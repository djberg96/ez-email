### Description
A very easy interface for sending simple text based emails.

### Installation
`gem install ez-email`

### Synopsis
```ruby
require 'ez-email'
   
EZ::Email.deliver(
  :to      => 'your_friend@hotstuff.com',
  :from    => 'you@blah.com',
  :subject => 'Hello',
  :body    => 'How are you?'
)
```
   
### Rationale

When I originally created this library the existing list of email handling
libraries were either not designed for sending email, were extremely cumbersome,
had lousy interfaces, or were no longer maintained.
   
I just wanted to send a flippin' email! This library scratched that itch.
Hopefully you will find its simplicity useful, too.

Update: Since I wrote this there is also now the Pony library which is almost
as simple and more flexible since it can also handle attachments, among other
things. Consequently, these days I would generally recommend that library over
this one for sending simple emails:

However, I will continue to maintain this library for now.

### Local Testing
To run the specs you will need a mail server running locally. If you do not
already have a mail server running on port 1025 then install docker and run
the following command:

`docker compose run mailhog`

Once the mailhog docker image is installed and running, you can run the specs.
You can also view the emails that were generated by pointing your web browser
at http://localhost:8025 after running the specs for visual verification.
