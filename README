= Description
   A very easy interface for sending simple text based emails.

= Installation
   gem install ez-email

= Synopsis
   require 'ez/email'
   
   EZ::Email.deliver(
     :to      => 'your_friend@hotstuff.com',
     :from    => 'you@blah.com',
     :subject => 'Hello',
     :body    => 'How are you?'
   )
   
= Rationale
   The present batch of email handling libraries are either not designed
   for sending email, or are extremely cumbersome, have lousy interfaces,
   or are no longer maintained.
   
   I just want to send a flippin' email! This library scratched that itch.
   Hopefully you will find its simplicity useful, too.

= Bugs
   None that I'm aware of. Please log any bug reports on the project page at
